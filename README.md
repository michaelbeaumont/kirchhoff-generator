Kirchhoff Network Generator
===========================

This program can generate random configurations of resistors and a source.
The resulting pictures and set of given information and questions
can be used as test questions.

At the moment only single-source networks can be generated.
However, multiple-source networks can be solved with the functions in Types.

To use:
kirchhoff-generator 1 [Number of questions] [Number of resistors (> 1)] [whether to show debug output]
